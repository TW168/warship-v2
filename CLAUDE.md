## What You Are Building

**Warship** — Warehouse and Shipping Management System

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) with SQLAlchemy + MySQL (`mysql-connector-python`)
- **Frontend:** Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5
- **Theme:** Light/Professional — White, Gray, IBM Blue (`#154e9a`), Open Sans font
- **Serving:** FastAPI serves both JSON API endpoints and Jinja2-rendered HTML templates

---

## Development Commands

```bash
# Create venv and install all dependencies (first time or after pulling)
uv sync

# Run the development server (uses .venv automatically)
uv run fastapi dev main.py --port 8088

# Add a package
uv add <package>

# Run a single test
uv run pytest tests/test_health.py -v

# Run all tests
uv run pytest
```

> `uv` manages the `.venv` automatically — never activate it manually or use `pip`.
> In VSCode: **Ctrl+Shift+P → Python: Select Interpreter → choose `.venv`**

## Architecture

### App Factory (`main.py`)
Creates the FastAPI app, includes all routers with prefixes, and mounts the `static/` directory.

### Database (`database.py`)
Hardcoded connection — do not move credentials to env vars unless asked:

```python
user = "root"
password = "n1cenclean"
host = "172.17.15.228"
port = 3306
database = "warship"
# connection string: mysql+mysqlconnector://root:n1cenclean@172.17.15.228:3306/warship
```

The `connect_to_database()` function returns a SQLAlchemy `Engine`.

### Routing Pattern
- HTML pages use `Jinja2Templates.TemplateResponse()`
- JSON API endpoints declare a Pydantic `response_model=` on the decorator and return a model instance — never a raw dict
- Pydantic schemas live in `schemas/` (e.g. `schemas/health.py`), separate from SQLAlchemy models
- All routers use `APIRouter()` and are included in `main.py`

### Pages & Routes

| Page | Route | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Home | `GET /` | Opens with weather images + gas prices card + quick access nav |

| Warehouse | `GET /warehouse` | UDC hourly bar chart, UDC history line chart, ASH event heatmap — queries `udc_hourly_ash`, `udc_ash`, `event_ash` tables directly via SQLAlchemy |
| Shipping | `GET /shipping` | Filter bar (date range, site, product group) drives Carrier Cost Analysis card |
| Carrier Cost Analysis | `GET /api/carrier-cost-analysis` | JSON — calls `sp_carrier_cost_per_pound`; params: `date_from`, `date_to`, `site`, `product_group` (all optional); returns carrier_id, bl_count, total_weight, total_pallets, total_freight_cost, cost_per_pound. Card embedded at bottom of `/shipping` page with Plotly bubble chart + sortable table. |
| TSR Prep | `GET /tsr-prep` | Available-to-ship BL list + Google Map with nearest-neighbor lines and radius circles. Same-city customers are jittered so each gets a separate pin. |

| Shipping Status CRUD | `GET /maintenance/shipping-status` | Maintenance data-entry page for table `shipping_status` with inline update/delete and create form. |
| Shipping Status API | `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /maintenance/api/shipping-status...` | JSON CRUD endpoints for `shipping_status` (`id`, `Date`, `Customer`, `Con_Hou`, `Con_Rem`, `Con_PHO`, `Con_CHA`, `Total`, `Hou_ship`, `Rem_ship`, `Con`). |
| Freight ¢/lb Audit | `GET /maintenance/freight-audit` | Cross-checks ¢/lb calculations across all pages using 3 independent methods (Unit_Freight weighted avg, Freight_Amount all-in, SP). Shows per-carrier breakdown and sample BL verification. |
| About | `GET /about` | |
| Health | `GET /health` | Returns `{"status": "ok", "service": "warship", "version": "0.1.0"}` |

### Software Architectural Page
The route reads a Markdown source file and renders it to HTML using **Pygments** for syntax highlighting. A **JavaScript-generated Bootstrap scrollspy TOC sidebar** is built from heading elements at page load. Required sections: Introduction, System Overview, Architectural Styles & Patterns, Technology Stack, Data Model, Folder Structure, API Endpoints, Deployment & Scaling, Security & Compliance, Future Roadmap.

## UI/UX Standards

This app targets a professional internal tool audience. Every page must feel polished.

### Design System
- **Primary color:** IBM Blue `#154e9a` — used for navbar, buttons, active states, links
- **Font:** Open Sans via Google Fonts — load in `base.html`
- **Framework:** Bootstrap 5 — use utility classes first, custom CSS only when Bootstrap cannot achieve the result
- **Icons:** Bootstrap Icons (`bi-*`) — consistent throughout, never mix icon libraries

### Layout Rules
- All pages extend `base.html` — never inline a full HTML skeleton in a child template
- Page content sits inside a `container` or `container-fluid` with consistent vertical padding (`py-4`)
- Tables use `table table-striped table-hover table-sm` with a sticky `thead`
- Cards use `shadow-sm` for depth; avoid heavy borders
- Forms: labels above inputs, `form-floating` where it looks good, validation feedback always visible

### Interactivity
- Use **HTMX** for partial page updates (table refreshes, form submissions) — avoids full-page reloads
- Show a Bootstrap `spinner-border` during any async operation
- Use Bootstrap **Toast** (bottom-right) for success/error feedback — never use `alert()`
- Confirm destructive actions with a Bootstrap **modal**, not `confirm()`

### Responsiveness
- Mobile-first. Every layout must work at 375 px wide.
- Navbar collapses to hamburger on small screens
- Tables that cannot reflow wrap in `table-responsive`

### Accessibility
- All `<img>` tags must have descriptive `alt` text
- All form inputs must have a `<label>` or `aria-label`
- Color alone must never convey meaning — pair color with an icon or text

---

## Deployment

### Current: Direct (no container)
- App runs directly via `uv run fastapi dev main.py --port 8088 --host 0.0.0.0` on the host machine
- Dokploy is **not currently used** — may be adopted in the future

### Dockerfile (future / optional)
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /usr/local/bin/uv
WORKDIR /app
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./
RUN uv sync --frozen --no-dev
COPY . .
CMD ["uv", "run", "fastapi", "run", "main.py", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8088"]
```

### GitHub
- Default branch: `main`

---

## Coding Standards

- Every function and class must have a docstring or inline comments explaining the logic.
- Every API endpoint must have a `summary` and `description` in the decorator for Swagger docs.
- Use `APIRouter` in each router file; never define routes directly on the `app` object.

## Dependencies (current)

Managed via `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
